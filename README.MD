## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations and keyframes
- Flexbox for layout

### What I learned

In this project, I explored several key CSS animation techniques:

- I learned how to use @keyframes to create animations, like text typing and a pulsing heart.
- Created animations with delays, steps, and loops to make the text appear line by line.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Experiment with more complex animations and transitions.
- Enhance interactivity with JavaScript.
- Further improve accessibility features.
